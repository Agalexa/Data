Data analytics and visualization

"Data visualization is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed."

"Anything that has a row/column structure could potentially be used by Pandas for analysis/ visualization."

Goal: To visualize and analyze data. Recognize that effective data visualization is vital in the human interpretation of information. Explore novel ways to visual data in order to increase depth of understanding.
